# Recap: Quarterly Meeting
Our latest DST quarterly meeting was held on December 20th, 2023 with approximately 20 colleagues across both home and field offices.

We kicked off with a brief overview of our recent social network analysis and mapping brown bags. The team also highlighted contributions to a pivotal study by the Center for Global Development, focusing on early-grade reading assessment (EGRA) programs.

A significant portion of the quarterly meeting was dedicated to interactive breakout sessions. These sessions provided a platform for deep-diving into a variety of sampling scenarios. We explored how to effectively address and mitigate potential validity threats in these scenarios. Key discussions included:

- The influence of human choice on random sampling, emphasizing the need for enumerators to recognize and     account for these characteristics.
- In Third-Party Monitoring (TPM), the importance of being cognizant of biases, especially those related to   the locations selected for random sampling.
- Challenges and considerations in applying weights to ensure representativeness within the zone of           influence.
- Addressing the issue of survivorship bias, which can skew data by overlooking non-representative elements.

These discussions set the stage for our upcoming brown bag in February 2024, where we will delve into sampling best practices and techniques, informed by our recent scenario planning exercises.


# Recap: GIS COP January Meeting
Our in-house GIS Specialist Jacob Milley hosted the second GIS COP on January 23 with around 20 colleagues from varying projects/countries in attendance. The meeting included a recap of the first COP meeting, a presentation by Joaquin Martin Lopez on his GIS work for the El Salvador MEL project using ArcGIS Online, and finally a brief discussion on commonly used GIS data sources. The goal of this disucssion was for the GIS COP to establish an authoritative a list of freely accessible [GIS data sources](https://tetratechinc.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/MSIAdvancedAnalyticsWritingGroup/Shared%20Documents/GIS%20COP/GIS_Data_Sources.xlsx?d=web01598398674cfbaea8a4beb8f223c6&csf=1&web=1&e=Uot9f8) to help other GIS users at MSI get their hands on more available data!
