# Recap: GIS COP January Meeting
Our in-house GIS Specialist Jacob Milley hosted the second GIS COP on January 23 with around 20 in attendance. The meeting included a recap of the first COP meeting, a presentation by Joaquin Martin Lopez on his GIS work for El Salvador MEL project using ArcGIS Online and a brief discussion on GIS data sources. The GIS COP is planning to put together a list of available GIS data sources to help other GIS folk get their hands on more available data!

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
