## Brown Bags

## Learning Bursts

## Project Consultations

The Data Science Team recently held its first project consultation with AMELA to identify key areas for collaboration and support. The discussion focused on three priorities: conducting a trend analysis of flagged TPM data from 2019 onward, delivering tailored data analytics training to address team capacity gaps, and developing a lessons learned document centered on post-Taliban takeover activities. Sixteen AMELA staff completed the survey, detailing their existing data science capabilities and goals. As a result, the Data Science Team is now developing a tailored training program utilizing existing resources for the AMELA team. If you are interested in receiving similar support, please reach out to the Data Science Teamâ€”we look forward to connecting with your project teams soon!

The Data Science Team (DST) is a collection of colleagues at MSI that are interested in building and practicing data analytics skills, from the basics of descriptive analytics to advanced machine learning techniques. The core members of the Data Science Team are Dan Killian, Melanie Murphy, Tim Shifflett, Gunjan Maheshwari, Jack Payne, Jacob Milley and Thomaz Alvares. Each member brings a particular expertise to ensure that the team's initiatives are in line with MSI's commitment to incorporate advanced data analytics into our work. The core team supports MSI staff by:

-   Supporting staff conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis with guidance on best practice and available data sources.
-   Helping staff learn new data science techniques and applying the techniques to existing activities.
-   Providing trainings on the application of analyses across multiple analytical packages, as well as on core statistical concepts that underlie the analyses.
-   Holding structured trainings on-demand, at least once per year and 4-12 brown bag sessions per year.
-   Holding on-demand consultation with home office staff and project teams.
-   Providing a knowledge management function for past and current data science work at MSI while ensuring everyone knows about these resources.
