## Summary of the Virtual Training on Advanced Topics in Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning for MENA MELS

The training was designed to enhance the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) skills of USAID professionals, specifically addressing the unique challenges faced in the MENA region. The training included 16 short, pre-recorded videos divided into four modules, complemented by five two-hour virtual instructor-led training (VILT) sessions. Each VILT session included a recap of video topics, Q&A, interactive exercises, guest speakers, online games, and real-time polling. The training was facilitated by MSI experts Dan Killian, Thomaz Alvares de Azevedo, Melanie Murphy, Barbara Pando-Behnke, Tim Shifflett, and Jacob Milley. 

The first module of the training covered MEL policy context, randomized control trials, and evaluation design, and featured a TED Talk on impact measurement in conflict zones. The second module focused on statistical matching, cost analysis, complex sampling methods, and data collection techniques in conflict areas. The third module covered advanced modeling methods for logic models and learning agendas, and included a TED Talk on Geographic Information Systems (GIS).The final module explored the use and future applications of AI, large language models, and machine learning in MEL.

The data science team plans to roll out DST brown bags pulling from these training topics over the next several months. Training videos are found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHwXAdVj07tsPrPqtiXY3a68vEc2OImkQ).

## Publication Highlight: Pathways to reading comprehension in Amharic vary by reading profile

Thomaz Alvares from MSI and Marcia Davidson from the USAID Africa Bureau recently published their research on how ["Pathways to reading comprehension in Amharic vary by reading profile"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11145-024-10584-x). This article contributes to the Simple View of Reading (SVR) literature by using advanced analytics to validate the SVR framework for an understudied branch of writing systems, and by strengthening the broader base of evidence that print decoding skill plays a more dominant role than language knowledge in the early stages of reading comprehension development. The article also discusses that L2 status should play a substantial role in reading interventions in multilingual contexts, and it raises awareness among policymakers about the potential uses of data-driven classification approaches for evaluating both the start state and the differing effects of interventions within different subpopulations of learners. 

## Project Consultations

The Data Science Team recently held its first project consultation with AMELA to identify key areas for collaboration and support. The discussion focused on three priorities: conducting a trend analysis of flagged TPM data from 2019 onward, delivering tailored data analytics training to address team capacity gaps, and developing a lessons learned document centered on post-Taliban takeover activities. Sixteen AMELA staff completed the survey, detailing their existing data science capabilities and goals. As a result, the Data Science Team is now developing a tailored training program utilizing existing resources for the AMELA team. If you are interested in receiving similar support, please reach out to the Data Science Team â€” we look forward to connecting with your project teams soon!

## Introduction to Bayesian Analysis Brown Bag

The Brown bag on Introduction to Bayesian Analysis was held on November 16, 2024. Dan introduced the concept of Bayesian analysis, explaining its foundational importance for analysts and its practical application.

The session focused on the concept of Bayesian analysis, highlighting its foundational importance for analysts and its practical applications. The session served as a dry run for client deliverables, including an introduction to Bayesian analysis and an engaging example to stimulate critical thinking. Key topics discussed included the derivation of Bayes' rule using Venn diagrams, basic probability concepts, and the distinction between Bayesian and frequency analysis through a treatment effect example. The application of Bayesian analysis in inferential analysis was emphasized, illustrating how it can be used to estimate relationships between variables and update beliefs based on observed data. Real-world applications were also explored, including setting priors, evaluating evidence, and updating beliefs, with an illustrative example involving the probability of alien life. Additionally, the session addressed the use of Bayesian networks and causal modeling in attaching probabilities to different scenarios for data-driven decision-making. Follow-up tasks were identified, including gathering feedback on the presentation and selecting examples for future client presentations.

## Development Data Library Compliance Brown Bag

The Brown Bag session on Development Data Library (DDL) Compliance took place on September 26, 2024, led by Adam Weber. The session focused on key terms related to uploading final datasets to the DDL, a USAID-funded repository for storing data related to USAID projects. Adam provided a live demonstration on creating an account in the DDL and how to create a data asset. He also reviewed essential checklists for uploads, which include required documents such as codebooks and consent forms.

The Missing Men in STEM

Imagine a prestigious university with a strong STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) program. Admission decisions are based solely on standardized test scores, which are entirely unbiased and designed to measure aptitude. Historically, 60% of applicants are female, and 40% are male. However, after the admissions process, 70% of admitted students are female, and 30% are male.

When analyzing the data, you find:

- Male and female applicants have identical average test scores.
- The standard deviation of scores is also identical for both groups.

If the test scores and admission criteria are unbiased, why are males underrepresented among admitted students?

Overview
:::

::: box-container
The Data Science Team (DST) is a collection of colleagues at MSI that are interested in building and practicing data analytics skills, from the basics of descriptive analytics to advanced machine learning techniques. The core members of the Data Science Team are Dan Killian, Melanie Murphy, Tim Shifflett, Gunjan Maheshwari, Jack Payne, Jacob Milley and Thomaz Alvares. Each member brings a particular expertise to ensure that the team's initiatives are in line with MSI's commitment to incorporate advanced data analytics into our work. The core team supports MSI staff by:

-   Supporting staff conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis with guidance on best practice and available data sources.
-   Helping staff learn new data science techniques and applying the techniques to existing activities.
-   Providing trainings on the application of analyses across multiple analytical packages, as well as on core statistical concepts that underlie the analyses.
-   Holding structured trainings on-demand, at least once per year and 4-12 brown bag sessions per year.
-   Holding on-demand consultation with home office staff and project teams.
-   Providing a knowledge management function for past and current data science work at MSI while ensuring everyone knows about these resources.
